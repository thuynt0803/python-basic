Story 1:

	Today is still a cold winter day, sit and look at the sky for a while and realize:

	Cold winter, being alone doesn't mean being alone. Feeling missing someone, but not picking up and making a call.

	Love, a little further away, no problem ... because when you love, you should try to get along better together, understand each other better, love is when you want to work a little bit, day by day, and feel better together ...

	However, I really miss someone ...

Story 2:

	Hà Nội lại đón một đợt không khí lạnh nữa rồi đấy cậu ... 

	Mùa lạnh, mùa của những tương tư, mùa của nỗi nhớ, mùa yêu, và mùa xa nhau! 

	Nhìn lại một năm qua .. cậu có những kỉ niệm nào đáng nhớ không? 

	- Mình nghĩ là có đấy. Mình đã bỏ lỡ một vài thứ ... 

	Dù sao, dẫu Hà Nội Lạnh, nhưng trong cậu ấm là được nhỉ!
